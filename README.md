The main goal was to create a responsive, pretty to the eye website with interesting information about Italy. For this I used technologies such as HTML, SCSS, JS.  The JavaScript in this project is rather simple, mainly used for sliders, burger menus. In the project I presented the use of an external library, which is used to move images. I also created animated cards, with a butterfly wing effect. Below I have included a link to the site and screenshoots of the preview for mobile devices, as well as desktop.
